        <h1>The Trooper</h1>
                <br>

        <p>You'll take my life but I'll take yours too</p>
        <p>You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through</p>
       
      
      <p>  So when you're waiting for the next attack</p>
        
        <p>You'd better stand there's no turning back.</p>
        
        <br>
        
    <p> The bugle sounds and the charge begins</p>
        
    <p> But on this battlefield no one wins</p>
        
    <p>  The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath</p>
        
    <p> As I plunge on into certain death.</p>
        
<p><span class="special-font"> Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh</span></p>

<p><span class="special-font"> Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh</span></p>
        
                <br>

        
    <p> The horse he sweats with fear we break to run</p>
        
    <p> The mighty roar of the Russian guns</p>
        
    <p> And as we race towards the human wall</p>
        
    <p> The screams of pain as my comrades fall</p>
        
                <br>

        
    <p> We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground</p>
        
    <p> And the Russians fire another round</p>
        
    <p> We get so near yet so far away</p>
        
    <p> We won't live to fight another day.</p>
        
    <p><span class="special-font"> Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh</span></p>
        
    <p><span class="special-font"> Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh</span></p>
        
            <br>

        
    <p>    We get so close near enough to fight</p>
        
    <p>    When a Russian gets me in his sights</p>
        
    <p> He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow</p>
        
    <p> A burst of rounds take my horse below.</p>
        
                <br>

        
    <p> And as I lay there gazing at the sky</p>
        
    <p> My body's numb and my throat is dry</p>
        
    <p> And as I lay forgotten and alone</p>
        
    <p> Without a tear I draw my parting groan</p>
        
<p><span class="special-font"> Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh</span></p>

<p><span class="special-font"> Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh</span></p>
